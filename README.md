gototype
=========

Gototype is a less bro-joke-infused version of [Brototype](https://github.com/letsgetrandy/brototype)

## Features

You've got a deeply-nested set of objects that may or may not always be there.
We've all seen something like this:
`var myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');`
which leads to one of our favorite javascript errors...
`error: undefined is not a function`

And the solution only makes the code base ugly:
```
var myURL;
if (app && app.config && app.config.environment && app.config.environment.buildURL) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

We all hate that, don't we?

So what if you could just type:
```
var myURL;
if (Go(app).exists('config.environment.buildURL')) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

Or better yet, how about:
```
var myURL;
Go(app)
    .if('config.environment.buildURL')
    .then(function(val){
        myURL = val;
    });
```

Well, now you can!

## Features

### Testing nested members
```
if(Go(object).exists('lift')) {}
```
Or, just use a callback...
```
Go(object)
    .exists('property.subproperty', function(subproperty) {
        console.log(subproperty);
    });
```

### Fetching nested members
```
var value = Go(object).get('cheezeburger');
```

### Calling nested functions
```
Go(object)
    .if('method')
    .then(function(returnVal) {
        ...
    });
```

### Handling exceptions
```
Go(object)
    .if('method.name')
    .except(function(e) {
        console.log('error ' + e + ' happened.');
    });
```

### Extending objects
```
var obj1 = {foo: 'boo', bar: 'bar'},
    obj2 = {foo: 'bar', yes: 'no'};
Go(obj1).extend(obj2);

// now obj1.foo == 'bar' and obj1.yes == 'no'
```

### Extending Gototype!

```
var plugin = { foo: function() { whatever; }};
Go.prototype.extend(plugin);
```
